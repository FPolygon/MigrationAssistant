A comprehensive Windows migration tool that facilitates the transition of domain-joined, SCCM-managed computers to workgroup Entra-joined, Intune-managed devices. The tool ensures all user data is safely backed up to OneDrive before performing a system reset for Autopilot enrollment.

## Overview

This migration tool is designed to:
- Run as a Windows service deployed via SCCM with SYSTEM privileges
- Detect and manage multiple user profiles on shared computers
- Backup user data, application settings, and system configurations to OneDrive
- Block system reset until all active users have completed their backups
- Provide a post-reset restore wizard to help users recover their data

## Key Features

### Multi-User Support
- Detects all user profiles on the system
- Identifies active users (last login <30 days, profile >100MB)
- Blocks migration until all active users complete backup
- Provides manual override for inactive profiles

### Smart Notification System
- Non-intrusive but persistent notifications
- Avoids interrupting during meetings or fullscreen applications
- Detects camera/microphone usage
- Integrates with calendar systems
- Allows limited delays before escalation

### Comprehensive Backup
- **User Files**: Documents, Desktop, Pictures, Downloads, AppData
- **Browsers**: Bookmarks, passwords, extensions, sync accounts
- **Email/Outlook**: All versions, settings, signatures, rules, PST files
- **System Config**: WiFi profiles, credentials, network drives, printers

### IT Integration
- Automatic escalation for issues
- Detailed error reporting
- OneDrive quota management
- Large file handling (PST >5GB)

### Post-Reset Recovery
- Standalone restore wizard
- Category-based restoration
- Priority-ordered recovery (WiFi ‚Üí Browsers ‚Üí Email ‚Üí Files)
- Clear status reporting

## Architecture

The Migration Assistant consists of several components:

1. **Migration Service** (Windows Service)
   - Runs as SYSTEM
   - Orchestrates the migration process
   - Manages state across all users
   - Enforces multi-user blocking

2. **Migration Agent** (User Application)
   - Runs in user context
   - Shows notifications and UI
   - Handles user interactions
   - Reports progress to service

3. **Backup Engine**
   - Provider-based architecture
   - Supports files, browsers, email, system settings
   - Uploads to OneDrive

4. **Restore Wizard**
   - Standalone executable
   - Stored in OneDrive
   - Runs post-reset to restore data
